What Is Negative Air Pressure?

If An Enclosed Area Has A Lower Air Pressure Than The Area Around It, Air Is Sucked Into The Area.

How Can Air Pressure Your Staff from airborne Containments

A well engineered negative pressure room with constant monitoring of air pressure, can contain air-bone contaminants within the room preventing air-bone contaminants including Covid-19, from drifting to other areas and contaminating humans & equipments.

What Can Cirrus Consulting Do?
We can help you engineer a room with constant pressure monitoring to assure proper safe

What Do I Need To Setup Negative Pressure Environment
1. Properly engineered exhaust fan with HEPA filter.
2. Constant Negative Air-Pressure Monitoring
